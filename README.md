This repo hosts `FABLES` (Faithfulness Annotations for Book-Length Summarization), a dataset of model-generated summaries with atomic claims annotated for faithfulness. Labels are supported by evidence and the annotator's reasoning, while claim sets include a general comment on the quality of the summary.

## Introduction
While long-context large language models (LLMs) can technically summarize book-length documents (> 100K tokens), the length and complexity of the documents have so far prohibited evaluations of input-dependent aspects like faithfulness. In this paper, we conduct the first large-scale human evaluation of faithfulness and content selection on LLM-generated summaries of fictional books. Our study mitigates the issue of data contamination by focusing on summaries of books published in 2023 or 2024, and we hire annotators who have fully read each book prior to the annotation task to minimize cost and cognitive burden. In total, we collect annotations on 3,158 claims made in LLM-generated summaries of 26 books at a cost of $5.2K USD, which allows us to rank LLM summarizers based on faithfulness: CLAUDE-3-OPUS significantly outperforms all closed-source LLMs, while the open-source MIXTRAL is on par with GPT-3.5-TURBO. An analysis of the annotations reveals that most unfaithful claims relate to events and character states, and they generally require indirect reasoning over the narrative to invalidate. While LLM-based auto-raters have proven reliable for factuality and coherence in other settings, we implement several LLM raters of faithfulness and find that none correlates strongly with human annotations, especially with regard to detecting unfaithful claims. Our experiments suggest that detecting unfaithful claims is an important future direction not only for summarization evaluation but also as a testbed for long-context understanding. Finally, we move beyond faithfulness by exploring content selection errors in book-length summarization: we develop a typology of omission errors related to crucial narrative elements and also identify a systematic over-emphasis on events occurring towards the end of the book. We will release our annotations to spur further research on the evaluation of book-length summarization.

## Data

`FABLES` is a dataset created from book-length summaries of narrative books published in 2023-2024. The data contains:

ðŸª„ `Book Title` -- Title of the book used for summarization. Each title is a `dict` contaitning data related to the book.

ðŸª„ `Model Name` -- Name of the model that summariezed the book: MIXTRAL, GPT-3.5-TURBO, GPT-4, GPT-4-TURBO, or CLAUDE-3-OPUS. A `dict` containing all summary data for that model.

ðŸª„ `General Comment` -- (`str`) Overview of issues with the set of claims, including omissions of important information, chronology, salience (mention of unimportant events/details), factuality, and others like repetitiveness or vagueness, with each summary receiving a comment.

ðŸª„ `Summary` -- (`str`) Entire book summarized by one of five models: Mixtral, GPT-3.5-Turbo, GPT-4, GPT-4-Turbo, and Claude-3-Opus, using the hierarchical merging method described in [Chang et al.](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2310.00785.pdf).

ðŸª„ `Claims` -- (`dict`)  Numbered dictionary of decontextualized claims from each summary extracted using GPT-4.

ðŸª„ `Label` -- (`str`) Faithfulness label assigned by native English-speaking annotators based on their reading. Labels are **"Yes"** (accurate reflection), **"No"** (misrepresentation), **"PartialSupport"** (partially corroborated), or **"Inapplicable"** (indeterminable), applied to each claim.

ðŸª„ `Reason` -- (`list`) List of reasons provided by annotator' as a justification for each faithfulness label (provided for some claims).

ðŸª„ `Evidence` -- (`list`) List of evidence, source text quotations, provided by annotators to support their labels (available for most claims).

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
`FALBES` data is stored in a JSON file, formatted as follows:

```markdown
* `book title`: (str) 
  * `model name`: (str) 
    *  `summary`: (str) 
    *  `general_comment`: (str)
    *  `claims`: (dict)
       * `claim`: (str)
       * `label`: (str)
       * `evidence`: (list of str)
       * `reason`: (list of str)
```
Note_1: The `book title` and `model name` are placeholders for their actual values.
Note_2: In the `claims` dictionary, each claim is indexed numerically as a key, with each key pointing to a dictionary containing the fields `claim`, `label`, `evidence`, and `reason`.

Example entry:

```json
{
  "Wildfire": {
    "CLAUDE-3-OPUS": {
      "general_comment": "This summary is largely chronological (though Aurora's decision to not attend her father's wedding comes after Russ' father's visit) and hits the main thematic elements of the text, though it disproportionately addresses the epilogue over other portions of the text. The claims are factual, however.",
      "summary": "Wildfire, the first book in the Icebreaker series, follows the love story of Aurora Roberts and Russ Callaghan, two college students who meet while working as counselors at Honey Acres, a sleepaway summer camp in California. Aurora, the daughter of a famous Formula 1 team owner, struggles with her distant father's lack of attention and affection, often acting out to gain his notice but facing continual disappointment. Russ, a reserved hockey player at UC Maple Hills, deals with the shame and embarrassment of his father's gambling addiction, which has strained their family relationships.(...)",
      "claims": {
        "0": {
          "claim": "The book 'Wildfire' is the first in the Icebreaker series.",
          "label": "No",
          "evidence": ["n/a"],
          "reason": ["Not quoted in the book, but this is the second in the series, after 'Icebreaker'."]
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
